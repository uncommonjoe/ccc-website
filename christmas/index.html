				<b>Isaiah 9:6-7</b><br />
				6 For unto us a Child is born, to us a Son is given; and the
				government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name shall be
				called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
				Prince of Peace. 7 Of the increase of His government and of
				peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over
				His kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice
				and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore.
				The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.

				<b>Psalm 98:1–4</b><br />
				1 Oh sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done marvelous
				things! His right hand and His holy arm have worked
				salvation for Him. 2 The LORD has made known His salvation;
				He has revealed His righteousness in the sight of the
				nations. 3 He has remembered His steadfast love and
				faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the
				earth have seen the salvation of our God. 4 Make a joyful

			<p>
				<b>Luke 2:1–20</b><br />
				1 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that
				all the world should be registered. 2 This was the first
				registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 And all
				went to be registered, each to his own town. 4 And Joseph
				also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to
				Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
				because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be
				registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. 6
				And while they were there, the time came for her to give
				birth. 7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped
				Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger, because
				there was no place for them in the inn.
			</p>

			<p>
				8 And in the same region there were shepherds out in the
				field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And an
				angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the
				Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great
				fear. 10 And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold,
				I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the
				people. 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of
				David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby
				wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 And
				suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
				heavenly host praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in
				the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is
				pleased!”
			</p>

			<p>
				15 When the angels went away from them into Heaven, the
				shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem
				and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has
				made known to us.” 16 And they went with haste and found
				Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. 17 And when
				they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told
				them concerning this child. 18 And all who heard it wondered
				at what the shepherds told them. 19 But Mary treasured up
				all these things, pondering them in her heart. 20 And the
				shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they
				had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

			<p>
				O Holy night!<br />
				The stars are brightly shining<br />
				It is the night<br />
				of our dear Savior's birth.<br />
				Long lay the world<br />
				in sin and error pining,<br />
				'til He appears and<br />
				the soul felt its worth.<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				A thrill of hope<br />
				the weary world rejoices,<br />
				for yonder breaks<br />
				a new and glorious morn!<br />

				O hear the Angel voices!<br />
				O night divine,<br />
				O night when Christ was born;<br />
				O night, O holy night<br />
				O night divine!<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				Truly He taught us<br />
				to love one another;<br />
				His law is love<br />
				and His Gospel is peace.<br />
				Chains shall He break,<br />
				for the slave is our brother<br />
				And in His name,<br />
				all oppression shall cease<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				Sweet hymns of joy in<br />
				grateful chorus raise we;<br />
				Let all within us<br />
				praise His Holy name!<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				Christ is the Lord;<br />
				O praise His name forever!<br />
				His power and glory<br />
				evermore proclaim;<br />

			<p>
				<b>Matthew 2:1–11</b><br />
				1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
				of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to
				Jerusalem, 2 saying, “Where is he who has been born king of
				the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to
				worship him.” 3 When Herod the king heard this, he was
				troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; 4 and assembling all
				the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of
				them where the Christ was to be born. 5 They told him, “In
				Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
			</p>

			<p>
				6 “And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no
				means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall
				come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.”
			</p>

			<p>
				7 Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained
				from them what time the star had appeared. 8 And he sent
				them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the
				child, and when you have found Him, bring me word, that I
				too may come and worship Him.” 9 After listening to the
				king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they
				had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest
				over the place where the child was. 10 When they saw the
				star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. 11 And going
				into the house, they saw the child with Mary His mother, and
				they fell down and worshiped Him. Then, opening their
				treasures, they offered Him gifts, gold and frankincense and
				myrrh.

			<p>
				What Child is this who, laid&nbsp;to&nbsp;rest<br />
				On Mary's lap is sleeping?<br />
				Whom angels greet<br />
				with anthems sweet,<br />
				while shepherds watch are&nbsp;keeping?<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				Why lies He in such mean&nbsp;estate,<br />
				Where ox and lamb are feeding?<br />
				Good Christians, fear,<br />
				for sinners here<br />
				the silent Word is pleading.<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				This, this is Christ the King,<br />
				Whom shepherds guard<br />
				and angels sing;<br />
				Haste, haste, to bring Him&nbsp;laud,<br />
				the Babe, the Son of Mary.<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				So bring Him incense, gold and&nbsp;myrrh,<br />
				Come peasant, king to own&nbsp;Him;<br />
				The King of Kings<br />
				salvation brings,<br />
				let loving hearts enthrone&nbsp;Him.<br />

			<p>
				<b>Galatians 4:4–7</b><br />
				4 But when the fullness of time had come,
				God sent forth His Son, born of woman, born under the law, 5
				to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might
				receive adoption as sons. 6 And because you are sons, God
				has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying,
				“Abba! Father!” 7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son,
				and if a son, then an heir through God.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>John 1:1–5</b><br />
				1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the
				beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that
				has come into being. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 The light shines in the
				darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
